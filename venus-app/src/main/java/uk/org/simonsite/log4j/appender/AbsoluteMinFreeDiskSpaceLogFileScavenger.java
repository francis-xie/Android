/**
 * Responsible for periodically sampling the number of log files with a given
 * base filename and time-based extension, and for deleting the older files if
 * the minimum specified space remains available on the filesystem.
 * <p>
 * Requires Java 6 and up.
 * <p>
 * The use case of this Scavenger is when you want to use all but a certain
 * amount of your disk space for log file to keep as much logs as your system
 * permits without worrying about running out of disk space.
 * <p>
 * To determine free disk space, the AbsoluteMinFreeDiskSpaceLogFileScavenger
 * calls {@link File#getUsableSpace()}. Javadoc says this method &quot;Returns
 * the number of bytes available to this virtual machine on the partition named
 * by this abstract pathname...&quot;.
 * <p>
 * When running more than one AbsoluteMinFreeDiskSpaceLogFileScavenger (e.g. in
 * multiple applications or for different appenders) on the same partition, care
 * must be taken when configuring them: All
 * AbsoluteMinFreeDiskSpaceLogFileScavenger working on the same partition must
 * have the same value for <tt>MinFreeDiskSpace</tt>. If this is not the case
 * and the partition fills up, the scavenger with the highest
 * <tt>MinFreeDiskSpace</tt> value will start deleting it's log files. Because
 * of this scavenger deleting log files, the other scavengers will not start
 * deleting log files because their <tt>MinFreeDiskSpace</tt> is lower and will
 * not be hit. Finally the scavenger with the highest <tt>MinFreeDiskSpace</tt>
 * will have deleted all it's log files (which is likely not what should
 * happen!) and only then the disk may fill further so that the scavengers with
 * the lower <tt>MinFreeDiskSpace</tt> will start deleting logs.
